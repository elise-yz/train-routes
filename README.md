# train-routes
Demo of various algorithms to determine shortest route. Given a list of cities (nodes) across North America, finds the shortest train route from any city to any other. User can choose from the following algorithms to determine the route: Dijkstra, A*, DFS, ID-DFS, Bidirectional Dijkstra, Reverse A*, and Bidirectional A*.
